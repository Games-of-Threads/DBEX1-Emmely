# Database excersise 1 (Key-Value Stores)
This is a mini project for the database course. The excersise is based off the description in the buttom of this [resource](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-databases-teaching-material/blob/master/lecture_notes/01-Intro_to_DB.ipynb)
## Description
This excersise goal is to build a simple database system in any language. I choose to build it in Python. The excersise needs to have implemented a hashmap-based index, functionality to store data on disk in binary file and read the data again to reinstantiate the database after a shutdown.

The result is a Python module which can be used in any Python (3) program. 

------------------
## How to run it (example program)
- Pre-conditions: Have Python installed. [If you do not have Python 3 installed. Follow this guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/linux/)

To run the example program, simply start by cloning this repository. From your preferred terminal. (I'm using git bash)
```
git clone https://github.com/Games-of-Threads/DBEX1-Emmely.git
```
Then, go to the directory of the repository, and build and run with the following command.
```
python example.py
```
The output of the program is printed.
